Why do you use `*.bash` everywhere instead of `*.conf`?

Because `*.conf` doesn't support support inline comments and i hate spam + bash is more powerfull assuming not wasting cycles if anything but seting variables is used + `*.conf` reminds me of javalang.

TODO: Fetch `.bashrc` from https://github.com/Kreyren/GentooStuff/blob/master/.bashrc -> fetch only one file from repo.
